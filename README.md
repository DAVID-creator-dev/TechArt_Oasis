# TechArt Oasis

## Overview

TechArt Oasis is an interactive simulation project that allows users to create and customize an oasis environment. The project provides tools for modifying the size of the oasis and the surrounding forest using splines, enabling a dynamic and customizable landscape. Additionally, the project features a life simulation system where animals roam, hunt, and interact according to their position in the food chain.

The project is developed in a **collaborative context**, involving multiple disciplines:
- **Game Art**: puzzle design, mechanics, and progression
- **Game Programming**: system implementation, controls, and interactions

## Features

### Customizable Oasis Environment

- Users can adjust the size of the oasis and the surrounding forest using splines, offering full control over the landscape.

### Animal Life Simulation

- The project simulates animal behavior, including roaming, hunting, and interactions based on the food chain. Animals behave naturally within their environment.

### Camera System 

- **Free Roam Mode**: Users can control a third-person character to explore the entire environment.
- **Attach Camera to Animal**: Alternatively, users can attach the camera to an animal, following its movements and behavior.

|----------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Move Camera in Free Roam Mode** | `WASD`       | Use the standard WASD keys to move the character freely around the environment.               |
| **Follow Animal's Movement**     | `Mouse Click` | Click on an animal to automatically follow its movements and actions in the animal attachment mode. |
| **Rotate Camera**                | `Mouse Move` | Move the mouse to rotate the camera while attached to an animal or in free roam mode.              |
| **Exit Animal Camera**           | `é`           | Adjust the camera's angle vertically, moving up or down.                                           |
